# Face Recognition & Processing Pipeline
**Final Project Pemodelan dan Pembelajaran Mesin - Universitas Indonesia**

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an automated identity verification system using Deep Learning. By combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) for classification, the pipeline can accurately identify individuals from digital images.

## 🛠️ Technical Workflow
* **Data Preprocessing:** Implemented Python scripts for image normalization and data cleaning to ensure consistent input dimensions and improve training stability.
* **Feature Extraction (CNN):** Utilized Convolutional layers to automatically detect and extract unique facial patterns and spatial hierarchies.
* **Classification (BPNN):** Integrated a Backpropagation Neural Network to classify the extracted features into specific identities.
* **Evaluation:** Validated model performance using accuracy metrics and loss functions to ensure reliable verification.

## 💻 Tech Stack
* **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow & Keras
* **Data Manipulation:** NumPy, Pandas
* **Visualization & Evaluation:** Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn
* **Environment:** Google Colab
